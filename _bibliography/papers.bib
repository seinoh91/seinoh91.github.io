  ABSTRACT = {A 2-then-1-bit/cycle noise-shaping successive-approximation register (SAR) analog-to-digital converter (ADC) for high sampling rate and high resolution is presented. The conversion consists of two phases of a coarse 2-bit/cycle SAR conversion for high speed and a fine 1-bit/cycle noise-shaping SAR conversion for high accuracy. The coarse conversion is performed by both voltage and time comparison for low power consumption. A redundancy after the coarse conversion corrects the error caused by a jitter noise during the time comparison. Additionally, a mismatch error between signal and reference paths is eliminated with the help of a tail-current-sharing comparator. The proposed ADC was designed in a 28 nm CMOS process, and the simulation result shows a 68.2 dB signal-to-noise distortion (SNDR) for a sampling rate of 480 MS/s and a bandwidth of 60 MHz with good energy efficiency.},

ABSTRACT = {A CMOS (Complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor) Hall sensor with low power consumption and simple structure is introduced. The tiny magnetic signal from Hall device could be detected by a high-resolution delta-sigma ADC in presence of offset and flickering noise. Also, the offset as well as the flickering noise are effectively suppressed by the current spinning technique combined with double sampling switches of the ADC. The double sampling scheme of the ADC reduces the operating frequency and helps to reduce the power consumption. The prototype Hall sensor is fabricated in a 0.18-µm CMOS process, and the measurement shows detection range of ±150 mT and sensitivity of 110 µV/mT. The size of active area is 0.7 mm2, and the total power consumption is 4.9 mW. The proposed system is advantageous not only for low power consumption, but also for small sensor size due to its simplicity.},

abstract = {This Letter proposes a second-order bandpass ΔΣ ADC using a pipelined successive-approximation-register (SAR) ADC as an internal quantiser. The second-order bandpass noise-shaping is achieved by utilising the residue signal after SAR conversion and inherent delay existing in a pipelined structure. The proposed ADC can show very high resolution even with low-order noise-shaping and low oversampling ratio. Also, it shows good energy efficiency and a high sampling rate due to the use of a pipelined SAR ADC as a quantiser.},

Welcome :)!

My name is Sein Oh, and I am currently pursuing my Ph.D. at KAIST.\
I am highly self-motivated and deeply interested in devising efficient solutions to various problems and learning from the process.

My research interests include:

<ul style="padding-left:0.0; list-style-position: inside;">
<li>Mixed-Signal Integrated Circuits (Data Converters)</li>
<li>Sensor Interface Integrated Circuits</li>
<li>Wireless Communications</li>
</ul>

I am on the lookout for internship opportunities in IC design.\
Should you require any assistance or have questions, please feel free to contact me.

Also, I hold great respect for all individuals committed to learning. 

I look forward to connecting with you.\
Thank you!
